          <span class="text-primary">Question 1:</span> Discuss the scope of
          var, let, and const
        </h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Variables declared with var, let and const will be global scoped when
          they are declared globally outside of any function body or curly
          braces {} code blocks. That means they will be available globally. The
          difference between var and let, const variables comes into play when
          the question of function scope and block scope arises.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Variables declared with the var keyword are scoped to a function's
          scope when they are declared inside the body of a function which means
          they will be accessible anywhere inside a function body. var keyword
          variables ignore the block scope of code blocks with curly braces {}
          for example loop or conditional blocks which means even if they are
          declared inside a code block, they can still be accessed from outside
          of the said code block. Variables declared with var keyword are
          hoisted which means they can be used before they are declared in the
          code.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Variables declared with let and const keywords are scoped to a code
          block's scope when they are declared inside the curly braces {} of a
          code block such as loop or conditional blocks. They can accessed
          anywhere inside that same code block where they were declared but not
          from outside of that block, which means if there are separated code
          blocks (not nested) and they all have a variable with the same name
          which was declared with either the let or const keyword, it is valid
          as even though those variables have the same name, they are not the
          same variables. Variables declared with let or const keywords are not
          hoisted which means you can use them in your code only after they have
          been declared.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xl text-textPrimary font-extrabold mb-6">
          <span class="text-primary">Question 2:</span> Tell us the use cases of
          null and undefined
        </h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Null means the variable has been declared and null is the value which
          has been defined for the variable to explicitly indicate that the
          variable has an intentional absence of a value. Null can also be used
          to reset a variable's (such as a timer which was created with
          setTimeout or setInterval methods) value. After clearing the timeout
          or interval null can be set as the value of the timer to explicitly
          reset the timer variable.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Undefined means a variable has been declared but the value of the
          variable hasn't been defined yet. Undefined is the default value of a
          variable just after it has been declared in the code until a real
          value has been assigned to it. Undefined also indicates that the
          variable/property/function which the developer is trying to use in
          their code doesn't exist or hasn't been declared in the current scope.
          If you try to use a function without the arguments for its parameters,
          the local variables (parameters) gets the value of undefined. Also a
          function which doesn't return a value explicitly retunrs undefined
          implicitly.

      <!-- question 3 -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xl text-textPrimary font-extrabold mb-6">
          <span class="text-primary">Question 3:</span> What do you mean by REST
          API?
        </h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          REST stands for Representational State Transfer for an API. It can be
          consumed by websites, web and mobile applications to transfer data to
          and from a server. It can be used to create, read, update and delete
          data inside a database by using the POST, GET, PUT/PATCH & DELETE http
          methods respectively. It is an architectural style for designing an
          application programming interface (API). REST is not a new technology
          or a new language but rather a special way/design of creating APIs or
          web services. As any web development student can see, REST is the most
          popular principle of creating APIs in the current world.
